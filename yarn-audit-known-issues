The wrapper uses the module specifier to load the original module and add some wrapping code. It allows for remote code execution in cases where an application passes user-supplied input directly to an import() function.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been patched in `import-in-the-middle` version 1.4.2\n\n### Workarounds\n* Do not pass any user-supplied input to `import()`. Instead, verify it against a set of allowed values.\n* If using `import-in-the-middle` and support for EcmaScript Modules is not needed, ensure that none of the following options are set (either via command-line or the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable):\n```\n--loader=import-in-the-middle/hook.mjs\n--loader import-in-the-middle/hook.mjs\n```\n\n### References\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at [security@datadoghq.com](mailto:security@datadoghq.com)","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5r27-rw8r-7967"}},"muted":[],"metadata":{"vulnerabilities":{"info":0,"low":0,"moderate":0,"high":1,"critical":0},"dependencies":442,"devDependencies":1,"optionalDependencies":0,"totalDependencies":443}}
